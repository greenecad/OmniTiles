# OmniTiles - a universal tile map file convertor

OmniTiles is a program to convert between tmx, tscn, csv, json, and unitypackage tile maps.

Currently supports basic conversion functionality between all formats with the exception of unity. This project is still in very early development, so expect bugs.

## Usage
in the OmniTiles folder:
```console

py src filepath outputformat [flags]

```

outputformat is one of the file extensions listed above.
